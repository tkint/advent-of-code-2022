# Day 00

You might think :

> This day does not exist !! It's so stupid !

Well, yes. It might feel stupid, but it is not.

This folder serve the only purpose to setup the structure for the other challenges :

- `index.spec.ts` containing the solution
- `input.txt` containing the given input
- `README.md` to add some details

It also puts together the first util function : `getInput`.
